# Word-Guess-Game

This Project is a Word Guessing Game/Hang Man game using Javascript.
It was my first time ever building something with Javscript after having less than a week of learning the material. It proved difficult. But I got the game working pretty much how I wanted. 
One thing I could not complete was that when I would put a word in my array, i.e. Godzilla, It would register the two L's together as one entry, so it would mess up the letterTally. It would not register a win.
I created a couple functions in the game which at first I was struggling with the concept of, and am still learning exactly how they work. I hope to build on off of this game and strengthen my knowledge of Javascript and maybe even come back and make this game run better.
